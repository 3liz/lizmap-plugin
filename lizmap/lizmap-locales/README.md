Contributing
============

We are using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/3liz-1/lizmap-locales/) to
translate our application. So we prefer you contribute on Transifex instead
of modifying directly this repository.

On transifex, you can help to translate existing strings, or you can create a new
language and translate into this language. When you are finished to create your
localization, open an issue on github to inform us the new language, and
we will update localization strings into lizmap. 


Web Client locales
-------------------

All the locales for the Web Client is in the web-client directory.

Files are .po file, but there are not used directly by Lizmap, as Lizmap is
using an other file format (properties). We are using a script to convert po files 
to properties files and vice-versa.  

Plugin locales
----------------------------

All the locales for the Web Client is in the plugin directory.
